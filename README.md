# Explainable Fraud Alert System

## Overview
The Explainable Fraud Alert System uses machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, providing clear and understandable explanations for flagged transactions. This system integrates Isolation Forest model with a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating human-readable explanations. The solution aims to enhance customer trust, improve fraud detection accuracy, and meet regulatory compliance by offering transparent fraud alerts.

## Contents

### 1. Abstract
A brief overview of the project, the algorithms used, and the problem solved.

### 2. The Code
A Python-based implementation that combines Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies and fraudulent transactions. It also includes an LLM-based explanation engine to provide clarity on why a transaction was flagged.

### 3. Output
The output of the system, showcasing detected fraudulent transactions and the corresponding explanations for each flagged transaction.

### 4. Presentation (PPT)
A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the problem, methodology, and business impact of the project.
